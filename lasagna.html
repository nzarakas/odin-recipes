    <h1>Lasagna Recipe</h1>
    <img src="./lasagna.webp" alt="Image of lasanga">
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
        A more traditional 
        homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
        I have found none better anywhere. 
        Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
